### 🌿Hi, nice to see you!

### 🌿About me

I’m **Dorota**, a **Software Engineer** from Poland 🇵🇱  

Right now I work mostly as a **DevOps** or **Cloud Engineer**, building platforms for electrical engineers to run heavy simulation software in the **cloud** ☁️⚡

Outside of work, I sometimes share **small personal projects** here. I code because it’s fun. 🧠✨ I genuinely **love teaching people tech** and making complex things easier to understand.

🎓 **My education**

- 🏫 BSc in Power Engineering ⚡ — Gdańsk University of Technology  
- 🎓 MSc in Computer Science 👾 — PJATK  

Because I realised:

> Energy needs software.  
> And software without domain knowledge is… *meh*.

So I mixed both. And here we are 🚀
