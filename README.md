### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m **Dorota**, a **Software Engineer** from Poland 🇵🇱  

Right now I work mostly as a **DevOps** or **Cloud Engineer**, building platforms for electrical engineers to run heavy simulation software in the **cloud** ☁️⚡

Outside of work, I sometimes share **small personal projects** here. I code because it’s fun. 🧠✨ I genuinely **love teaching people tech** and making complex things easier to understand.

### 🎓 My Education

- 🏫 BSc in Power Engineering ⚡ — Gdańsk University of Technology  
- 🎓 MSc in Computer Science 👾 — PJATK  

**Because I realised:**

> Energy needs software.  
> And software without domain knowledge is… *meh*.

So I mixed both. And here we are 🚀

I promise I have better taste in code than in random jokes.

Comedy is random. Taste is subjective. Please don’t judge me by this joke. 😂
